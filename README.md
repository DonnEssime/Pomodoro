# Java-based Pomodoro timer

This is a Java-based version of a Pomodoro timer (see http://tomato-timer.com/), and as a result this program will be system-independent.
Be warned however: I took this on as an exercise to build a UI from the ground up - it is unlikely you will be wanting to re-use any of the code.
